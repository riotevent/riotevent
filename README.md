Welcome to Riotevent, the most awesome event website project ever, working with mean stack (mean-js). Some cool dudes are making it in the alps with love, beer and cheese.

Run "npm install" to install all the dependencies.
Run "grunt" to start the server and open your browser on http://localhost:3000/.
