##Riotevent Project
Riotevent is a work in progress project to create an independent event platform.

The aim is to create an open source, free, self-hostable platform, to publish, share and interact with real life events.

The current build is based on [MEAN-JS](https://github.com/meanjs/mean).

Run "npm install" to install all the dependencies.
Run "sudo grunt" to start the server and open your browser on [http://localhost:3000/].
